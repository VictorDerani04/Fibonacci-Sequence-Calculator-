This code runs three different ways to calculate and print the Fibonacci sequence: recursion, dynamic, and closed formula.
It also calculates the time that it takes to print in each way.
It is good to see the difference of time between the methods.
The user should call this code from the command line. An example is "60 2000", where 60 is the maxInput and 2000 is the maxTime.
